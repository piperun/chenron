# Chenron

A desktop-focused link and bookmark manager. Similar in spirit to
[Karakeep](https://github.com/karakeep-app/karakeep), but local-first.

## Features

* Desktop support - runs on Linux and Windows (macOS untested, volunteers welcome)
* All data stored locally via SQLite
* Hierarchical folder storage (folders within folders)
* Tag support for both links and folders
* Customizable UI with theme support
* Import and export bookmarks as standard HTML (Netscape format), compatible with all major browsers
* Full database export and import for backup and migration
* Experimental archive.org / archive.is support to reduce link rot

## Who should use Chenron?

Honestly, [Karakeep](https://github.com/karakeep-app/karakeep) is
probably more battle-tested if you want a self-hosted solution.

Chenron exists because none of the existing bookmark managers quite
fit what I wanted in terms of UX and workflow.

If that resonates, give it a try.

## Roadmap

Chenron v1.0 is the first stable release as a bookmark manager.

As such the current focus is on ensuring stability, in terms of: using it
daily, finding edge cases, and fixing bugs before adding new features.

Future milestones (v1.x) include document support, AI-assisted
tagging, and JSON import/export for power users.
